# Haskell dev server

Minimal dev server stack with zsh, stack and ghcid.

Your executable should run a haskell webserver (e.g. Servant).
Clone this repository into your haskell repo and run the
three scripts in seperate terminal windows

- A bash loop running your program (Provide the path to the executable)
- A file watcher recompiling and terminating old programs
- A ghcid window
